                                        	<p>I bought my second car and had them tint my windows. It went really well. I brought my car first thing in the morning and after only a couple of hours they were able to set everything up right away. Everything looked amazing. There were no cuts in my car. No melted rubber from the heat gun. They did everything I asked for and it look amazing.<br>I gave 4 stars because I saw trash on the back of my truck from the tinting. But overall I would go again.</p>

                                        <p>This shop is amazing. Amazing communication and even brought up ideas on how I could spend less money. I have worked with so many other shops that have tried to rip me off or add extra charges. It was so refreshing to work with a shop that is actually on your side.</p>

                                        <p>Big S/O to Sayed from MUM Sports for taking care of my car and doing an amazing job! Few weeks ago I dropped off my 2020 Dodge Charger to get my wheels powder coated (satin black) and to get a red stripe down the middle of my car. Came out looking fire!!!! Highly recommend!</p>

                                        <p>I was referred to Mum Sports and called for a quotation. They responded promptly listened to my concerns of product quality, price, timing and scheduling. Called back after checking references and competition. The following Monday I dropped off my car and then picked it up on the following Thursday as quoted. I feel like I got good value and the team at Mum Sports performed as they said beforehand, which is important to me. Cheers guys another happy customer.</p>

                                        <p>Mr Khalil is a gem. I brought my 2019 Tesla for a chrome delete and password by protection film. The price was extremely competitive. But besides the price the customer service was great. He gave me a ride home and picked me up when finished. Thank you Mr Khalil. I will refer my friends to you.</p>

                                        <p>Needed Xpel reinstalled on my repaired bumper. Not only did he do a same day install, but quoted me cheaper than everyone else I called. Did excellent work in a very timely manor. Will be having MUM do why windows next!</p>

                                        <p>Mums Sports saved my me! I had such an awful wrap done on my Panamera that it really made me hate my car, I didn't even want to drive it anymore, was so embarrassing, until I Called Mum Sports and on the spot I got the confidence that things will be alright. Mum Sports gave me a quote on the spot, scheduled me to come in and in less than a 4 days my car was ready! And omg, they made my car look amazing. I'm so happy with their work and their professional staff and one of kind. Thank you for saving my car and for all your help.</p>

                                        <p>My car just finish installed paint protection film today at Mum Sports. (1) Their price is VERY competitive. (2) Their services are really good and detail orientated. (3) Really good customer service, give me a ride to my work when I drop off my car this morning. This place is a little bit hard to find, it locates in a plaza which has a lot of auto service related shops, if your GPS tells you here is the place, don't question that, park your car and walk around the plaza, at the end of the plaza, you will find this shop. Overall, I highly recommend this shop to everyone who wants his/her car looks pretty and beautiful!</p>

                                        <p>Sayed was great and the work done by his team was first class. I especially appreciated their care with COVID-related issues. The car looks fantastic, and I can look at my rims again without cringing at the curb rash. Terrific experience.</p>
